# UniGuru LM Robustness Audit — Day 1

## Objective
This document audits the current behavior of UniGuru Language Model to identify safety, robustness, and determinism gaps.

## Areas Audited
- Ambiguous user questions
- Long-form content requests
- Emotional or distressed user inputs
- Cultural or sensitive queries
- Unsafe or prohibited requests

## Key Observations

### 1. Ambiguous Queries
- The model attempts to answer even when the user intent is unclear.
- No clarification is requested before responding.
- Responses may assume intent incorrectly.

### 2. Long-Form Content
- Long answers may lose structure.
- No deterministic fallback if response becomes too long.
- Risk of hallucinated details.

### 3. Emotional or Distressed Inputs
- Emotional signals are not explicitly detected.
- Responses may continue normal flow instead of calming or safe responses.

### 4. Sensitive / Unsafe Queries
- Refusal boundaries are inconsistent.
- Some unsafe topics are reframed instead of refused.
- No explicit explanation of refusal logic.

### 5. Silent Failures
- Some inputs result in low-quality or generic responses.
- No logging or visibility into why a response was chosen.

## Summary
Current UniGuru LM performs well for normal educational queries but lacks strong safeguards, deterministic fallbacks, and emotional safety handling under edge cases.
